## **Introduction**

**Wonky Fighters** is a fast-paced, physics-based roguelite fighting game where you battle for glory as a gladiator in a arena. Developed in Unity and C#, the game's core mechanics revolve around a unique **ragdoll combat system** that makes every fight unpredictable and dynamic. This project was a significant part of my development journey, created over a 6-month period as a submission for the **BAFTA Young Game Developers Competition**.
